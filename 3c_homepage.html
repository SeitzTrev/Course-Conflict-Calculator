		<h3>Welcome to 3C!</h3>
		<p>3C is a faculty tool which will help professors eliminate class conflicts
		for students, such as having classes which are co-requisite scheduled at the same time.  The intention
		is to give students a smoother college career, rather than needing to wait to take certain requisites.
		</p>
		<h3>What you will need:</h3>
		<p>Faculty members need to upload a spreadsheet of classes they plan to teach to the 3C calculator.
		This is done on the 3C Calc page.</p>
